/*

To create a CLI, you have to choose the technology. 
I want to say  that you can use any technology you are comfortable with as long as it can be run in a terminal.

Historically we had languages like C, Pearl, Python that were very well represented and then for a few years now we've had Rust and Go already because these languages are relatively fashionable but we must also recognize that they have a tooling that is very well adapted to do CLI.
