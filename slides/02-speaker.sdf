/*

Quickly, 

I'm Stéphane Philippart I'm a developer advocate at OVHcloud: a French cloud provider.

I've been a Java developer for about 20 years, I've started to use Java when it was 1.0.2.
I'll let you calculate my age.

I'm the co-creator of a great meetup in Tours, just 1 hour train from Paris.

And, of course, as you can hear, I'm French so forgive my terrible accent.
