/*
I'm Stéphane Philippart I'm a dev advocate at OVHcloud: a French cloud provider.
Who knows OVHcloud? And who knows it for the public cloud products? 

I've been a Java developer for about 20 years, I've started to use Java when it was 1.0.2.
I let you calculate my age.
I'm co-creator of a great TADx Meetup in Tours 1 hour TGV from Paris.

And, of course, as you can hear, I'm French so forgive my terrible accent.
